- Status calculations reflect the logged work entry

**Visual Assessment:**
- Dynamic status updates working correctly
- Green status indicator for completed maintenance item
- Additional maintenance item (Chain Lubrication) properly integrated
- Mileage calculations accurate based on logged work

## Suspected Issues

- **JavaScript Error in Settings Edit Function**: While not visually apparent in the screenshots, the testing session referenced a JavaScript error when attempting to edit maintenance items in the Settings tab. The "Edit" buttons are visible and properly styled but may not function correctly.

- **Missing Error States**: No visual error handling appears to be implemented - forms and buttons appear functional even when underlying JavaScript may fail.

- **Date Display Inconsistency**: Work history shows "Last modified: 9/14/2025" while work entry date is "9/13/2025", suggesting either timezone issues or inconsistent date handling.

## Suggested Checks

### Accessibility (a11y)
- **Color Contrast**: Verify red "Never performed" status badges meet WCAG contrast requirements
- **Keyboard Navigation**: Test tab navigation between maintenance items and buttons
- **Screen Reader Support**: Add aria-labels to status indicators and maintenance intervals
- **Alt Text**: Header motorcycle icon needs descriptive alt text
- **Focus Indicators**: Ensure all interactive elements have visible focus states

### SEO
- **Meta Tags**: Add description and keywords for motorcycle maintenance tracking
- **Page Title**: Current title appears generic, should include motorcycle model specifics
- **Semantic HTML**: Review heading hierarchy (h1, h2, h3) for proper structure
- **Schema Markup**: Consider structured data for maintenance schedules

### Performance
- **Image Optimization**: Header motorcycle icon should be optimized for web
- **CSS/JS Minification**: Review if assets are minified for production
- **Local Storage Usage**: Monitor storage size with extensive work history entries
- **Responsive Design**: Test layout on mobile devices and tablets
- **JavaScript Error Handling**: Implement try-catch blocks around edit functionality
- **Data Validation**: Add client-side validation for mileage and date inputs

### Functional Testing
- **Edit Functionality**: Debug and fix JavaScript error in Settings tab edit functions
- **Data Persistence**: Verify LocalStorage reliability across browser sessions
- **Export/Import**: Test data export/import functionality thoroughly
- **Edge Cases**: Test with very high mileage values and future dates
- **Browser Compatibility**: Test across different browsers and versions
